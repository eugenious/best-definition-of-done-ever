## Motivation

**Why do we need a Definition of Done?**

In Agile software development, "Definition of Done" is a well-known concept.

It's done! Or is it? Stop guessing and start _knowing_ when your work is done!

**But why are we _really_ doing this?**

Ahhh, yes, there is more to it than that!

Here goes: we believe that code quality directly translates
into desirable business outcomes such as fast delivery, minimal bugs, no security
issues... In short, _working software_ (hat tip to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)). As
developers, we intuitively know that technical debt is bad, but human nature
being what it is, it's easy to cut corners when nobody is looking.

We also believe that fostering a culture of software craftsmanship is the best path
to quality code. But how can we do this? One powerful tool is taking all our
best practices, and codifying it into a Definition of Done. By making a checklist,
we take the guesswork out of quality ‚Äî it is no longer an opinion or an option, it
is either done or not done.

In summary, following a Definition of Done leads to high quality code which is essential for working software, which makes everybody happy!

A note on the meaning of the emojis:

- ‚≠ê An essential best practice
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê A recommended best practice
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê An ideal best practice
- üëé An anti-pattern. Don't do this!
