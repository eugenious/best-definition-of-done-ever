# Definition of Done ‚Äî For a Story

## A story is done when...

<details>
<summary><b>üö¶ 1. Code has been <i>peer-reviewed</i> and <i>merged</i> to a hosted code repository</b></summary>

_Writing Code_

- ‚≠ê It should go without saying: The source code for the project is stored in a hosted, version-controlled, code repository
- ‚≠ê New code enters the codebase via a Pull Request (PR), also known as a Merge Request (MR)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê New code improves the codebase, so that it is in a better state than it was before

_Pull Request Checklist_

- ‚≠ê There is a Pull Request checklist (possibly several, one for each type of change)
- ‚≠ê The PR checklist includes the elements of a well-formed PR (meaningful commit messages, no accidental changes, tests passing, etc)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The PR checklist incorporates many items from this Definition of Done (especially those related to PR creation, quality gates, testing, and documentation)
- üëé Don't make the PR checklist _too_ complicated, otherwise developers may get lazy and stop filling it out
- üëé Don't let the PR checklist get out of date

_Creating the Pull Request_

- ‚≠ê The Pull Request checklist is filled out by the author of the PR
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The PR is concise enough for a reviewer to be able to understand the code with relative ease
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The PR is a fully-functioning unit of change, and is production ready (able to be deployed to production without issues, possibly in an inactive state)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Each commit in the PR is for a single purpose and has a clear commit message (sometimes called "hiding the sausage making", a somewhat controversial topic)

_Reviewing the Pull Request_

- ‚≠ê The Pull Request is reviewed by 2 other engineers
- ‚≠ê One of the reviewers is a core maintainer of the project
- ‚≠ê The PR checklist is reviewed for accuracy
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The code is reviewed line by line, and understood by the reviewer
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê At the discretion of the reviewer, the code and/or tests are executed ("kicking the tires")
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê For a more rigorous and opinionated treatment on the topic of developer collaboration, see [The Main Gig](https://github.com/eugenious/the-main-gig)
- üëé Code reviewers just "rubber-stamp" the change without actually reviewing it
- üëé Too many "back and forth" comments on a PR usually indicates that the PR has not been adequately prepared

<details>
<summary><b>üî¨ 2. Code has passed <i>quality gates</i></b></summary>

- ‚≠ê Code is checked for issues (formatting, linting, potential bugs) using an automated tool
- ‚≠ê No new security findings (including open source vulnerabilities)
- ‚≠ê All tests are passing
- ‚≠ê New code has adequate unit test code coverage (meets minimum requirements)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Quality gates are all executed automatically and block a PR from being merged if any are failing
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Unit test code coverage of 100% (yes, that's the goal!)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üèÑ 3. Code has been <i>deployed</i> to a testing environment</b></summary>

- ‚≠ê Deployable artifacts are created using a Continuous Integration server (not on a local workstation!)
- ‚≠ê Deployable artifacts are stored in an artifact repository
- ‚≠ê Code is deployed from an artifact repository to a hosted test environment (non-production)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Code is automatically deployed once it has been merged into the codebase
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Quality gates are all executed automatically and block a deployment if any are failing

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üß™ 4. There are <i>tests</i> that prove all scenarios and acceptance criteria are satisfied</b></summary>

- ‚≠ê Acceptance criteria (applies to all stories in the project) are written out and understood by the team, and may include items such as localization, logging, analytics, etc...
- ‚≠ê All test scenarios for the story are written out in detail (ideally, using Given-When-Then syntax
- ‚≠ê Features are considered done only when there are passing tests
- ‚≠ê Test scenarios are gathered into a suite for future use
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The tests results are kept somewhere for future reference
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Automated tests are executed against the test environment (not just locally)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **All** integration tests are automated
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Integration tests are executed automatically by a Continuous Integration system

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üìù 5. There is <i>documentation</i></b></summary>

- ‚≠ê The documentation is appropriate for the project
- ‚≠ê The documentation is accurate and up-to-date
- ‚≠ê The documentation is easy to find
- ‚≠ê The documentation is in a suitable format
- üëé There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, so don't over-document

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üèÅ 6. Work has been reviewed and <i>accepted</i> by the product owner</b></summary>

- ‚≠ê The product owner has tried the feature or has been given a demo
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The product owner has reviewed the test scenarios and test results
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê The product owner confirms that all details of the story are accurate (description is complete, all subtasks are closed, fix version is assigned, etc...)
- ‚≠ê Finally, the product owner marks the story as done!
